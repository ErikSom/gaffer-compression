# Snapshot Compression Implementation in JavaScript

This repository contains a JavaScript implementation of the concepts discussed in the article ["Snapshot Compression"](https://gafferongames.com/post/snapshot_compression/) by Gaffer On Games. This project aims to provide a practical example of how snapshot compression can be achieved in JavaScript, particularly useful for game development and networked applications.
